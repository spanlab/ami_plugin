########################Notes for ami_extension_labDemo 220507#######################

As of now this only works on chrome.

You do not need a twitter account for this to work.
If you don't have an account you can go here: https://twitter.com/explore

AMI will overlay a continuously updated graphic on twitters UI to show you the affective breakdown of the current twitter page. (working to code different adaptive display options)

Every time you visit a different twitter feed or page on twitter you must reload the page so that the AMI graphic refreshes with an accurate count of that pages affective content.
