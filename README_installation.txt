########################Notes for ami_extension_labDemo 220507#######################

As of now this only works on chrome.

You do not need a twitter account for this to work.
If you dont have an account you can go here: https://twitter.com/explore

It will over lay on twitters UI so you need to make your web page bigger in order to see the ami breakdown piechart. (working to code different adaptive display options)

Every time you visit a different twitter feed or page on twitter you must reload the page so that the ami pie chart refreshes with a count of that pages content
