timeline... if we can get the data output function by the end of next week that would be AWESOME

features:
- get data out (json csv) 
	-category breakdown based on the twitter page you are viewing and specified number of tweets
		-example: source:FoxNews, column for each category, column for number of tweets, column for percentage (this one being priority number one)

- get background javascript scrolling to work so we can:
	- add buttons giving you x number of tweets to breakdown
	- 50 tweets - 100 tweets - 150 tweets -200 tweets
	-(maybe this is easier to do by giving the data to web sourced js script?)

- add emojis at midpoint of each arc (I can send link of video, i almost had it working)


- auto refresh the piechart when it detects we are on a new feed
- auto turn on view tweets by latest instead of top tweets (its a setting you click on the homepage)

- send data to the chrome plugin
	- maybe makes the design cleaner

- dark mode compatible 
 
- integrate a settings menu into the piechart
- different display options
- get open source copy right
	- he wants people to be able to use it for free but also get credit for creating the tool
		- citations or people adding to it
